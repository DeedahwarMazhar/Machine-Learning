# Machine-Learning
This is a repository for various Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects. This repository contains 5 folders containing my Academic Course Projects/Assignments, Semester Project(Cricket Prediction), Research Work, Final Year Project and Satellite Imagery Analysis projects.

Given below is a basic description of the folders in this repository.
# 1) Analysis of Reforestation Potential using Machine Learning
This is my Final Year Project, currently in progress. It is a multi-image analysis of satellite image data using Unsupervised ML Algorithms, Deep Auto-encoders and other deep learning models. It aims to identify areas in Pakistan having high potential for Forestation. 

# 2) ECG Multi-class Classification 
This is a research project to analyze multi-class ecg classification for 13-16 classes for heartbeat data.

# 3) Cricket Prediction Project
This was my semester project for the subject of Machine Learning which aimed to predict the results of the 2021 world T20 Cricket Tournament. The model was able to predict 3/4 correct semi-finalists as well as showing an almost 80% accuracy on the test data.

# 4) ML Assignments and Labs

This is a collection of my Labs and Assignments for coursework related to Machine Learning and Image Processing.

# 5) Machine Learning on Satellite Images

This is a repository of some practice notebooks for Machine Learning on Satellite images of 12 bands from Sentinel-2 for a better understanding and preparation to help my FYP.
